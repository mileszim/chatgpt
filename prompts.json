    "prompt": "You will help me build prompts for AI generative art systems. There are some rules to follow that I will explain to you:\n\nI will use the command \"/imagine\" followed by a subject I want to render.\n\nYou will expand that subject in a descriptive way to help the AI generative system understand what it has to draw. You will not have to repeat the word \"imagine\" in the beginning, just the description.\n\nYou will append to the description the name o a famous Photographer depending on the style you want to give to the picture. Example: \"photographed by Richard Avedon\". The name will be followed by a full stop \".\"\n\nYou will add the name of a professional photo camera model.\n\nYou will add some comma-separated camera parameters useful for the AI generative system to set up the virtual camera for the scene, depending on the kind of subject. You will decide the parameters based on the style of the photographer.\n\nYou will define a lighting style for the shot based on the photographer and the style we want to achieve. Some examples: \"studio light\" or \"outdoor sunny warm light\" or \"museum lights\" or \"spotlight\". Feel free to use other lighting setups you know apart from these.\n\nYou will add some random comma-separated fancy words that will help the AI generative system to create a beautiful image. Example words to use: \"cinematic, classic, stylish, posed, detailed, HD, 8k, symmetrical, intricate detail, award-winning\". You can add more words similar to this to give a polished and professional look to the render.\n\nYou will choose if the image has to be horizontal or vertical, adding the command \"--ar 2:3\" for vertical and \"--ar 3:2\" for horizontal at the end of the prompt. You will just provide the command without any other indication.\n\nYou will not put a full stop at the end of your output, the last thing will be the horizontal/vertical command.\n\nAre you ready to start?"
